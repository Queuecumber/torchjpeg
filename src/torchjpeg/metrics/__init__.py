The :code:`torchjpeg.metrcs` package provides useful metrics for measuring JPEG quality. All the 
metrics in this package take inputs in format :math:`(N, C, H, W)` and produces outputs of format
:math:`(N)` by averaging spatially and over channels. The batch dimension is not averaged. Inputs
should be images in [0, 1].
