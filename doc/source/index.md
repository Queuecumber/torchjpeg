## Documentation

The documentation is split into two parts. In the first part we discuss useful tasks that can be performed with the libjpeg functions. In the second part, we provide a packge reference in the form of generated API documentation. This part is also available as python docstrings. The latest documentation is always available at [https://torchjpeg.readthedocs.io](https://torchjpeg.readthedocs.io).
